A Unix daemon that periodically updates DigitalOcean domain records with the current machine's public IP address.

## How it works

The daemon periodically runs the following steps:

* finds the current machine's public IPv4 by sending a DNS request to an OpenDNS resolver
* queries the configured domain records using DO's API. If the queried IPs
  are different from the current public API, the domain records are updated to point to the new IP

## Setup

* A Unix (Linux / macOS) server to run the daemon
* A DigitalOcean account with your domain associated to it
* An existing `A` record for each domain to be updated

## Usage

There are 2 configuration modes: **simple** and **advanced**.

**Simple** mode allows updating only one *single* domain record.
Simple mode can be configured via command line arguments, environment variables or a config file.

**Advanced** mode allows updating *multiple* domains and records.
Advanced mode can only be configured via the config file.

See [do_ddns.sample.toml](./config/do_ddns.sample.toml) for a sample configuration file.

Run `do_ddns -h` to see the available command line options and environment variables.

## Build requirements

To build the application you need a recent enough version of the Rust compiler (1.45+).
Build using `cargo build`. The executable will be placed into `$PWD/target[/target-arch]/do_ddns`.

## Docker images and docker-compose

Docker images based on Alpine Linux (~7MB) are available for your server-y needs.

They are regularly built using Github Actions for the following platforms:

* `linux/amd64`
* `linux/arm64`
* `linux/arm/v7`

They can be downloaded from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/alcroito/digitalocean-dyndns) and the [Github Container registry](https://github.com/users/alcroito/packages/container/package/digitalocean-dyndns).

An easy way to use them is via the sample [docker-compose.yaml](./docker/docker-compose.yaml) file.
